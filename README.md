# git_practical_exercises_pull_push
This repository is the base for a practical git exercise.
This exercise is a beginner level one and it is focusing on practising pull and push.

## Exercise:

1. Run the script "init.py". This script will initialize three repositories in the folder:
* main_repo: this is a bare main repo, you don't have to touch it at all.
* johns_repo: inside this folder you find a clone of the main_repo. This is the repository used by your colleague John, don't touch it!
* students_repo: inside this folder you find a clone of the main_repo. This is your repository, please work inside this repository.

2. Create a file called "students_file.txt" in your repository, stage it and create a commit with the commit message "Add student's new file".

3. Try to push this commit, if there's any change on the remote branch in the meanwhile just let your branch be merged with the remote one.

4. Check your solution by running check.py

## Hint:

In order to be able to push, you have to pull first.
